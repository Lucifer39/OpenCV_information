# OpenCV_information
This repository contains code snippets for the implementation of OpenCV in your projects.

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today's systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.

# Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

I created this repostory to keep most of the basic functionalities of OpenCV in one place which can be reused in other projects.
